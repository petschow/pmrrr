# pmrrr

##Overview

*pmrrr* is a hybrid distributed-memory implementation the algorithm of
 Multiple Relatively Robust Representations for the real symmetric
 tridiagonal eigenproblem. It is used for MRRR-based Hermitian eigensolvers
 - an open-source software for distributed-memory dense linear algebra. 


## Mixed precision

A prototyp using extended precision internally to improve accuracy can be
found in the TAGS folder.
